\chapter{Improving Routine Climate Model Evaluation}
\label{ch:03:esmvaltool}

In order to answer the research questions of this thesis posed in
\cref{sec:01:research_questions}, a reliable tool to read, process and evaluate
output from climate model simulations is necessary. A valuable software that
fits these criteria is the \ac{ESMValTool}. The \ac{ESMValTool} is an
open-source community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the routine
evaluation of \ac{ESM} output, which particularly facilitates the analysis of
\ac{CMIP} models (\url{https://www.esmvaltool.org}). For this reason, all
analyses presented in
\cref{ch:04:assessment_climate_metrics,ch:05:paper_ecs,ch:06:paper_gpp} of this
thesis were implemented into the \ac{ESMValTool}. Apart from that, further
substantial contributions to the code base of the \ac{ESMValTool} have been
made, which lead to co-authorship in the four peer-reviewed studies that
provide its scientific documentation \autocite{Eyring2020, Lauer2020,
  Righi2020, Weigel2020}. After a brief overview over the \ac{ESMValTool}'s
structure, this chapter presents all these contributions that are not
documented in other chapters of this thesis.
