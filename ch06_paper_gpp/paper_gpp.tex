\chapter{Constraining Future Gross Primary Production with Machine Learning}
\label{ch:06:paper_gpp}

As argued in detail in the previous chapter, single-process-oriented emergent
constraints do not seem to be beneficial in constraining climate projections
from the vastly complex modern-day \acp{ESM} since they might overly simplify
the problem. To overcome this issue, we explore an alternative approach that
expands the \acf{MDER} method with a supervised \acf{ML} algorithm. In contrast
to emergent constraints, this approach considers (1) multiple process-based
predictors, (2) multi-dimensional (gridded) target variables and (3) non-linear
relationships between the predictors and the target variable. Since the new
technique relies on a large number of data points in order to train the \ac{ML}
algorithm, \ac{ECS} as a single scalar metric for each climate model is not an
appropriate target variable. As an alternative, we analyze projections of
future \acf{GPP} in this study, which constitutes the largest flux of the
terrestrial carbon uptake. As described in detail in
\cref{subsec:02:carbon_cycle_perturbations}, the global carbon cycle actively
slows down global warming by removing \ac{CO2} from the atmosphere. In
particular, the terrestrial biosphere absorbs about $30 \unit{\%}$ of the total
anthropogenic \ac{CO2} emission \autocite{Friedlingstein2020}. Thus, accurately
quantifying the future evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink is crucial for
reliable climate change projections.

Due to complex feedback processes connected to the global carbon cycle
(concentration-carbon feedback and climate-carbon feedback; see
\cref{subsec:02:carbon_cycle_perturbations}), the response of the terrestrial
carbon cycle to changes in the atmospheric \ac{CO2} concentration and climate
is a major source of uncertainty in climate projections \autocite{Bodman2013,
  Booth2012, Collins2013}. This applies for example to multi-model projections
of future \ac{GPP} of the \acs{CMIP}5 ensemble. Thus, the aim of this study is
to reduce uncertainties in multi-model projections of future \ac{GPP} in the
\acs{CMIP}5 \acs{RCP}8.5 scenario at the end of the \nth{21} century with a new
\ac{ML}-based weighting technique and appropriate observations. The new
two-step approach utilizes aspects of emergent constraints and the \ac{MDER}
technique in combination with a \ac{ML} algorithm. In the first step, we apply
an existing emergent constraint on \ac{CO2} fertilization \autocite{Wenzel2016}
to constrain the \acp{ESM}' responses to rising atmospheric \ac{CO2}
concentration using observations of the increase of the \ac{CO2} seasonal cycle
amplitude at \ac{KUM} \autocite{Keeling2005}. In a second step, we introduce a
supervised \ac{ML} algorithm based on boosting trees \autocite{Friedman2001} to
learn an empirical spatial relationship that links grid-wise future \ac{GPP} to
historical processes relevant to its simulation under present-day conditions.
In combination with observational products of the predictors, that relationship
can be used to further constrain uncertainties in the projected spatial maps of
\ac{GPP} at the end of the \nth{21} century in the \acs{RCP}8.5 scenario. We
examine both constraining the absolute \ac{GPP} and the fractional change in
\ac{GPP} as two independent approaches and target variables. Unlike univariate
linear regression used in the \ac{MDER} algorithm, the proposed \ac{GBRT}
algorithm is able to handle multiple predictors and copes with non-linearities
in the data. \ac{GBRT} is a well-known and successful tool used for
interpolation, classification and prediction in other fields of data science
and engineering \autocite{Death2007, Elith2008}. In the context of climate
science, \ac{GBRT} was recently applied to identify the key drivers of spatial
variations of the ratio of plant transpiration to total terrestrial
evapotranspiration in \acp{ESM} \autocite{Lian2018}.

This work is already published in \textcite{Schlund2020}. For this paper, the
author of this thesis lead the writing and the analysis and implemented the
code to reproduce this study with all figures and tables using the
\ac{ESMValTool}. \Cref{sec:06:data_and_methods} of this chapter provides an
overview of the data and methods used in this paper. The results are presented
in \cref{sec:06:results} and \cref{sec:06:summary_and_discussion} closes with a
summary and discussion.

    Moreover, this constraint is used to rescale two different gridded target
    variables: absolute \acs{GPP} at the end of the \nth{21} century and
    fractional \acs{GPP} change over the \nth{21} century. In step 2, a

    observation-based values of the diagnostic (black points) are fed into the
    trained \acs{ML} model to constrain \acs{GPP} for every grid cell/month to

  \caption{(a) Box plot of the \acf{RMSEP} distributions for six different
    statistical models used to predict future absolute \acf{GPP} in step 2a
    using a leave-one-model-out \acl{CV} approach. The distribution for each
    statistical model contains seven elements (black points; one for each
    climate model used as truth) and is represented in the following way: The
    lower and upper limit of the blue boxes correspond to the $25 \unit{\%}$
    and $75 \unit{\%}$ quantiles, respectively. The central line in the box
    shows the median and the black \enquote{x} shows the mean of the
    distribution. The whiskers outside the box represent the range of the
    distribution. Compared to the \acs{CMIP}5 \acf{MMM} and its corresponding
    rescaled version (r\acs{MMM}), the prediction uncertainty measured by the
    mean \acs{RMSEP} is significantly reduced by up to $48 \unit{\%}$ and $39
    \unit{\%}$, respectively, when using other statistical models. Moreover,
    the non-linear \acf{GBRT} models can slightly reduce the mean \acs{RMSEP}
    compared to the linear \acf{LASSO} models by about $2 \unit{\%}$ for
    \acs{GBRT}-1D (using historical \acs{GPP} as single predictor) and $3

    red bars correspond to positive Pearson correlation coefficients between

    relationship with the future \acs{GPP}, the historical \acs{GPP} is by far
    the most important predictor in the model. A local feature importance map
    using \acf{LIME} is not shown here because \acs{GPP} is the dominant
    predictor for all grid cells. \AdaptedFrom{Schlund2020}.}

  \caption{(a) Ratio of the rescaled \acs{CMIP}5 ensemble mean of the
    fractional change in \acf{GPP} over the \nth{21} century using
    \cref{eq:06:xxx} (r\acs{MMM}; see \cref{fig:06:step2b_results:b}) and its
    unweighted version (\acs{MMM}; see \cref{fig:06:step2b_results:a}). The
    plot shows an almost constant value over the whole globe with a mean of
    $0.91$, which corresponds to the ratio of the constrained global mean
    \acs{GPP} change over the \nth{21} century from step 1 ($39 \unit{\%}$)
    and the \acs{CMIP}5 ensemble mean global mean GPP change ($43 \unit{\%}$).
    All values close to $0$ for the dataset in the denominator have been
    masked to avoid divisions by $0$. Absolute (b) and relative (c)
    differences between the fractional \acs{GPP} change over the \nth{21}
    century predicted by the \acf{GBRT} model (see
    \cref{fig:06:step2b_results:d}) and r\acs{MMM} (see
    \cref{fig:06:step2b_results:b}). For panel (c), all values close to $0$ for
    the dataset in the denominator have been masked to avoid divisions by $0$.
    Both plots show a good agreement over large parts of the globe
    (corresponding to values of $0$). There are large absolute differences in
    the Sahara region and central Asia. The largest relative differences
    (except for the Sahara and Arabian Peninsula region) appear over South
    America, South Africa, the west coast of Africa, the Middle East, parts of
    Australia and western parts of the United States.

    century (\range{2091}{2100}) calculated using step 2a (a) and step 2b (b).
    Both approaches give similar results with global averages of $169
    \unit{\GtCyr{}}$ (a) and $175 \unit{\GtCyr{}}$ (b), which are both
    consistent with the global result of step 1 of
    $\pmrangeunit{171}{12}{\GtCyr{}}$. The pattern correlation between both
    approaches is $R^2 = 0.97$. Bottom row: Absolute (c) and relative (d)
