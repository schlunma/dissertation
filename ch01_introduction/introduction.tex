\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:01:introduction}


\section{Motivation}
\label{ch:01:motivation}

- Why is climate change relevant for the society?

- Cite latest warming reports, also other variables (droughts, extreme events,
etc.)

- basic physics of greenhouse gases (vibration modes, etc.)

- definition of radiative forcing

- well-mixed greenhouse gases (water vapor, CO2, CH4) + sources

- long-lived vs. short-lived GHGs?

- aerosols + cooling effect

- natural vs. anthropogenic effects (D \& A) -> clear evidence that climate
change over 21st century is caused by human influence

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{sec:01:structure}

Parts of this thesis are published in multiple peer-reviewed publications (two
first-author studies and six co-author studies). If applicable, this is clearly
stated at the beginning of each chapter. \Cref{ch:02:scientific_background}
introduces the scientific background for this thesis. This includes relevant
literature that is used as a baseline for this thesis. \Cref{ch:03:esmvaltool}
gives an overview over the contributions made to the \ac{ESMValTool}, an
open-source software for the analysis of \acp{ESM}. These contributions helped
improving the routine evaluation of \acp{ESM} which is useful for the whole
scientific community and lead to co-authorship in four peer-reviewed studies
\autocite{Righi2020, Eyring2020, Lauer2020, Weigel2020}.
\Cref{ch:04:assessment_climate_metrics} covers the assessment of
policy-relevant climate metrics like the \ac{ECS} and the \ac{TCR} in the
latest generation of \acp{ESM}. This work is already published in two
scientific publications \autocite{Bock2020, Meehl2020}. Since the \ac{ECS} and
\ac{TCR} are considerably higher in this new climate model generation,
\cref{ch:05:paper_ecs} describes the assessment of emergent constraints (a
technique to reduce uncertainties in multi-model climate projections, see
\vref{subsec:02:emergent_constraints}) on the \ac{ECS} for these \acp{ESM}. The
contents of this chapter are published in \emph{Earth System Dynamics}
\autocite{Schlund2020a}. \Cref{ch:06:paper_gpp} focuses on a new method to
reduce uncertainties in multi-model projections of the future climate based on
\ac{ML}. As an example, the method is applied to the photosynthesis rate at the
end of the \nth{21} century, which is already published in the \emph{Journal of
  Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences} \autocite{Schlund2020}. Finally,
\cref{ch:07:summary_outlook} provides a summary of the results of this thesis
and gives an outlook of possible future works.
