\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:01:introduction}


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:01:motivation}

- Why is climate change relevant for the society?

- Cite latest warming reports, also other variables (droughts, extreme events,
etc.)

- basic physics of greenhouse gases (vibration modes, etc.)

- definition of radiative forcing

- well-mixed greenhouse gases (water vapor, CO2, CH4) + sources

- long-lived vs. short-lived GHGs?

- aerosols + cooling effect

- natural vs. anthropogenic effects (D\&A) -> clear evidence that climate
change over 21st century is caused by human influence
(https://globalwarmingindex.org/, Haustein et al., 2017)

- remove description of emergent constraints from section 1.3, since this will
probably be included in this section.

- answer question: what is climate sensitivity? What is \ac{ECS}? What is
\ac{TCR}? What is \ac{CMIP}?

- One sentence on \ac{ML}.


\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:01:research_questions}

This section will present the \textbf{AWESOME} research questions!!!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did climate sensitivity change in the latest generation of climate
  models from \acs{CMIP}6 and can we see progress compared to older climate
  model generations?

  \item Can we use emergent constraints established in \acs{CMIP}3 and
  \acs{CMIP}5 to reduce uncertainties in climate sensitivity in the \acs{CMIP}6
  ensemble?

  \item Can we use \ac{ML}-based approaches to constrain gridded projections of
  the future climate with observations?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{sec:01:structure}

Parts of this thesis are already published in multiple peer-reviewed
publications (two first-author studies and six co-author studies). Unless
stated otherwise, results, discussions and conclusions presented from these
studies originate from the author of this thesis. A detailed list of
corresponding references is given at the beginning of the relevant chapters.

This thesis is structured as follows: \Cref{ch:02:scientific_background}
introduces the scientific background. This includes relevant literature that is
used as a baseline for this thesis. \Cref{ch:03:esmvaltool} gives an overview
over the contributions made to the \ac{ESMValTool}, an open-source software for
the analysis of \acp{ESM}. These contributions helped improving the routine
evaluation of \acp{ESM} which is useful for the whole scientific community and
lead to co-authorship in four peer-reviewed studies \autocite{Eyring2020,
  Lauer2020, Righi2020, Weigel2020}. \Cref{ch:04:assessment_climate_metrics}
covers the assessment of policy-relevant climate metrics like the \ac{ECS} and
the \ac{TCR} in the latest generation of \acp{ESM}. This work is already
published in two scientific publications \autocite{Bock2020, Meehl2020}. Since
the \ac{ECS} and \ac{TCR} are considerably higher in this new climate model
generation, \cref{ch:05:paper_ecs} describes the assessment of emergent
constraints (a technique to reduce uncertainties in multi-model climate
projections, see \cref{subsec:02:emergent_constraints}) on the \ac{ECS} for
these \acp{ESM}. The contents of this chapter are published in \emph{Earth
  System Dynamics} \autocite{Schlund2020a}. \Cref{ch:06:paper_gpp} focuses on a
new method to reduce uncertainties in gridded multi-model projections of the
future climate with observations based on \ac{ML}. As an example, the method is
applied to the photosynthesis rate at the end of the \nth{21} century, which is
already published in the \emph{Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences}
\autocite{Schlund2020}. Finally, \cref{ch:07:summary_outlook} provides a
summary of the results of this thesis and gives an outlook of possible future
works.
