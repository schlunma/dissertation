\chapter{Declaration of Authorship}

I assure that this thesis is a result of my personal work and that no other
than the indicated aids have been used for its completion. Furthermore I assure
that all quotations and statements that have been inferred literally or in a
general manner from published or unpublished writings are marked as such.
Beyond this I assure that the work has not been used, neither completely nor in
parts, to pass any previous examination.
