\chapter{Assessment of Climate Sensitivity in the \acs{CMIP}6 Ensemble}
\label{ch:04:papers_ecs_tcr_assessment}

In order to reduce uncertainties in multi-model climate projections, a first
important step is the assessment of the desired target variables in the
corresponding climate model ensemble. This is particularly relevant when a new
generation of \acp{ESM} is published that includes considerable modifications
compared to the respective predecessor model versions. Currently, we are in a
situation like this with the \acs{CMIP}6 ensemble, for which new data is still
released every day (as of \TheMonth{}). In light of the upcoming international
climate assessment of the \ac{IPCC} (\ac{AR6}), the evaluation of
policy-relevant metrics like \ac{ECS} or \ac{TCR} for these new \acs{CMIP}6
models is crucial since they provide vital information about the future climate
of planet Earth. As the \ac{ESMValTool} is an excellent tool that allows for a
quick and robust evaluation of new \ac{CMIP} data as soon as it gets published
on the \ac{ESGF} servers (see \cref{sec:03:esmvaltool}), we use it to assess
and analyze climate sensitivity (expressed by \ac{ECS} and \ac{TCR}) of the
\acs{CMIP}6 models and compare it to corresponding results of predecessor model
generations. This work is already published in two scientific papers:
\textcite{Bock2020} and \textcite{Meehl2020}.


\section{Evaluation of \acs{ECS} and \acs{TCR} in \acs{CMIP}6}
\label{sec:04:evaluation_ecs_and_tcr}

Following \cref{subsec:02:ecs}, \ac{ECS} is calculated with the Gregory
regression method using \ac{GSAT} and \ac{TOA} net radiation data for 150 years
of a \nxcotwo{4} simulation \autocite{Gregory2004}. In contrast to that, the
transient response of the climate system \ac{TCR} is calculated from \ac{GSAT}
data of a \onepctcotwo{} run \commentcite{Bindoff2013}{see
  \cref{subsec:02:tcr}}.
