\chapter{Assessment of Climate Sensitivity in \acs{CMIP}6}
\label{ch:04:assessment_climate_metrics}

In order to reduce uncertainties in multi-model climate projections, a first
important step is the assessment of the desired target variables in the
corresponding climate model ensemble. This is particularly relevant when a new
generation of \acp{ESM} has been published, which has happened in 2020 with the
\acs{CMIP}6 ensemble.
